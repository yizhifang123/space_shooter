STRINGS:
.lower() makes all lowercase
.upper()makes all uppercase

.replace("your word or letter", "your new word or letter") replaces the first word with the second word

.find("your word") finds the index of the word

"your word" in your variable|||| tells if there is the word in that variable

OPERATIONS:
+ = addition operation
- = subtraction operation
* = multiplication operator
/ = decimal division operator
// = whole number division operator
% = remainder for division
** = exponent operation

NOTE:
PEMDAS applies in python

COMPARISON OPERATIONS:
< = less than
> = greater than
== | equal comparison
!= | not equal comparison

LOGICAL OPERATIONS:
and = print(1>0 and 2>1) if the operations are all true it will print true else it will print false
or = print(1>1 or 2>1) if at least one operation is correct it will print true
not = print(not 10>11) for this it will print true if print(not 2>1) it will print false

LIST METHODS:
numbers = [1]
your variable that represents a list.append(what you want to add to your list)
your variable that represents a list.remove(what you want to remove from the list)
your variable that represents a list.clear() clears your list
print(len(your variable that represents a list)) prints how much words/numbers are in your list

TUPLES:
numbers = (1)
your variable that represents a list.count(what you want to count in your list = x) prints how much times they see x in your list.
your variable that represents a list.index(what you want to index = x) prints the index of the first occurance of x.

NOTE:
Tuples can not be changed

ARRAY:
your variable = {your list}
print(your array variable[the word/numbers index]) this prints the number that has the index you put
the array variable.pop(the index)    this deletes the number/word the is represented by the index
the array variable[the index] = "the new word/number"
the array variable.remove("what you want to remove")    removes the word/number that you put in the parentheses
the array variable.sort()   sorts your list in alphabetical order
the array variable.sort(reverse = true)  changes the list in alphabetical order then reverses your list
your variable.append("what you want to add")
your variable.clear()   clears you array
your variable.copy()      copies the array
your variable.count("what you want to count")  prints how much occurrences of the word.number you entered
your variable.extend(what you want to extend)   adds the things you inserted in the parentheses to the variable
your variable.index(what you want to index)    tells you the index of the number/word you put in the parenthesis
your variable.insert(the index, "what you want to add")   adds the thing you put in quotations to the index you put

Method	Description

clear()	Removes all the elements from the list
copy()	Returns a copy of the list
count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()	Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the first item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()	Sorts the list

# PYGAME
start with this loop:

while not crashed:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
